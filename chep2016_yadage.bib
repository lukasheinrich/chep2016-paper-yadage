abstract="Searches for new physics by experimental collaborations represent a significant investment in time and resources. Often these searches are sensitive to a broader class of models than they were originally designed to test. We aim to extend the impact of existing searches through a technique we call recasting. A framework designed to facilitate the usage of this technique, called RECAST, is presented. We illustrate the issues and subtleties involved through several examples, including new results obtained from the reanalysis of archived LEP data.

  abstract={AMI is the main interface for searching for ATLAS datasets using physics metadata criteria. AMI has been implemented as a generic database management framework that allows parallel searching over many catalogues, which may have differing schema, and may be distributed geographically, using different RDBMS. The main features of the web interface will be described; in particular the powerful graphic query builder. The use of XML/XLST technology ensures that all commands can be used either on the web or from a command line interface via a web service.}
